# Code Refactor Starter Code
Objective: Clean up HTML and CSS file using semantics and logical structure. Add alt text to images for accessibility and improved SEO. Add descriptive title.

Challenges: Understanding prior code and how divs are structured/connected to their corresponding classes. Ran into most trouble with main sections, the "Search Engine Optimization" to "Social Media Marketing" part. Consolidated all into a single element, not resulting in everything colliding together. Failed to realize that each section is it's own element until later, then rectified the issued and continued with the assignment.

Changes: 
- Removed all div elements and replaced with semantic elements
- Removed redundant class/id elements in side section
- Added title
- Cleaned up landing image; removed redundant img url
- Combined elements in CSS file where appropriate
- Reorganized CSS elements in hierarchial order/how they appear in the HTML file
- Added alt text for images
